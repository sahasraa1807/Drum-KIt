#  Simple Drum-KIt
This project is a Simple Drum Kit created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an interactive, on-screen drum kit that responds to both mouse clicks.
# How it Works:
When you click on a drum key (e.g., A, S, D, F), or press the corresponding key with your mouse, the associated audio plays.
The key that was clicked or pressed briefly scales up with a glowing effect to give feedback to the user.
# Purpose:
This project serves as an interactive musical experience, allowing users to play sounds like a simple drum kit through both keyboard keys and mouse clicks. It's a fun, educational example of using web technologies to create a musical interface.
